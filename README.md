## Overview
Creating a backend that can put data into a pre-made html site

## Getting Started
First you must install all of the root files and set up your tree correctly. Then initialize your files and server.js and configure it to respond to requests from the html site.

## Architecture
We are using Node.JS, JSON languages to manipulate Express, cors and dotenv. 

## Change Log
Initalized project -> Placed all of the initial files and started to adapt them to the assignment.

Added Location.json data implementation
